  <p>I am using Sublime Text as my text editor to complete this assignment</p>

    Planning a website includes several key components. These include identifying the purpose of the website, the users of the website, the computing environment of the users (ie. phone, tablet, laptop) and then designing a wire frame and site map that includes these key components. There are also some design elements to consider during planning such as graphics, navigation tools and typography to use, a color scheme and accessibility for all types of users.

    After reading Chapter 1, I know understand the pieces needed to effectively plan a website. I also tried out a few different text editors to create my HTML code before settling on Sublime. I also know the basic elements required to create a HTML page that the web broswer can use to read it.
